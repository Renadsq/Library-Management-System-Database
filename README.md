# Library Management System – Database Design

This repository presents a complete relational database design for a Library Management System.
The project covers entity extraction, relationship modeling, normalization, and SQL implementation.

## Project Overview
The system is designed to manage book borrowing and reservations by registered library members.
It tracks book availability, borrowing transactions, and reservation status while maintaining data integrity through proper database design.

## Scope of Work
- Extraction of relevant entities from system requirements
- Identification of relationships and cardinalities between entities
- Normalization of data from UNF to 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF
- Design of an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- Definition of relational schema with primary and foreign keys
- SQL implementation including table creation, data insertion, and queries

## Database Design
The database supports:
- Members and their borrowing activities
- Books, genres, and authors
- Borrowing transactions with due dates
- Reservation handling for unavailable books
- Book availability status (available, loaned, reserved)

## SQL Implementation
The project includes:
- SQL statements to CREATE all tables with constraints
- SQL statements to INSERT data from an unnormalised data source
- SQL SELECT queries to retrieve table contents
- JOIN queries to retrieve borrowing information along with member and book details

## Tools & Technologies
- Relational Database Design
- ER Modeling
- Data Normalization (up to 3NF)
- SQL (DDL & DML)
- SQLFiddle (Oracle SQL)
